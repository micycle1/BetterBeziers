# BetterBeziers
High-precision utils for 2D Cubic Bezier Curves

## Overview

This library offers high-precision methods for computing the length of a cubic bezier and finding the time `t` at which a specific arc length occurs.

* Length computation uses _Legendre-Gauss quadrature_.
* Finding time `t` for a specified arc length uses a hybrid approach of Newton’s method and bisection.

Both of these algorithms are described in _Moving Along a Curve with Specified Speed_ [[1]].

With these it becomes trivial to then sample the curve (find `t`) for a distance (or fractional distance) along the curve, as well as subdividing the curve into equal-length segments.
